Final Response:

# **IND-Enabling Non-Clinical Study Plan for an mRNA Influenza Vaccine**

## **Species Selection and Dosage Recommendations**

Toxicology Species: For repeat-dose toxicology studies, a single relevant animal species is generally sufficient, provided it mounts an immune response to the influenza antigen . Rodents (e.g. Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rats) are commonly used due to extensive historical data and proven sensitivity to vaccine-induced immune effects . Rats have been utilized in prior mRNA vaccine programs (e.g. COVID-19 vaccines) to successfully assess safety . A second species is not usually required for initial toxicity testing , unless warranted by unique aspects of the vaccine (e.g. a novel adjuvant or if rodent data are insufficient) . Non-human primates (NHPs, such as cynomolgus macaques) may be considered as a supplemental species for immunotoxicity or if the immune mechanism needs further characterization, but are not mandated if the rodent model is immunologically relevant . Both sexes should be included in toxicology studies (typically 5-10/sex/group in rodents) to detect any sex-specific effects.

Biodistribution Species: Small animals are recommended for biodistribution studies, with mice or rats being appropriate. Mice allow use of larger group sizes and potential transgene reporter systems (e.g. luciferase) for imaging , whereas rats provide greater blood and tissue volumes for analytical assays. Prior mRNA vaccine biodistribution studies have used rodents to map tissue distribution . Rodents are immunologically responsive to mRNA-LNP vaccines, ensuring that distribution data reflect relevant uptake (e.g. via lymphatics to lymph nodes) . A non-rodent species for biodistribution is generally not required; biodistribution patterns of LNP-formulated mRNA are largely determined by formulation and are similar across mammals .

Efficacy Model Species: Efficacy and immunogenicity evaluations should use influenza-susceptible species. The ferret (Mustela putorius furo) is the gold-standard small animal model for human influenza, as ferrets are naturally susceptible to human influenza viruses and exhibit human-like symptoms (fever, respiratory signs) upon challenge. Ferret models are routinely used to assess vaccine-mediated protection, including reduction of viral load and clinical signs after intranasal challenge . We recommend ferrets for viral challenge studies to demonstrate protection; for example, ferrets immunized with an mRNA flu vaccine showed protection from disease and death upon H5N1 or H7N9 challenge . Mice (e.g. Balb/c or C57BL/6) are also useful for immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy screening. Mice can be infected with adapted or high-dose influenza strains, providing a convenient model to evaluate dose-response of immune outcomes and even survival in lethal challenge models. Indeed, robust antibody responses and neutralization have been observed in mice given mRNA influenza vaccines . NHPs (such as rhesus macaques) may be considered to characterize immune responses in a phylogenetically closer model and to assess tolerability, but they often exhibit mild disease. Thus, NHP use can be reserved for cases where translation of immunogenicity needs confirmation or to support dose selection, rather than as a primary efficacy model.

Dosage Level Selection: Dose levels for animal studies should bracket the anticipated clinical dose and include a safety margin. Regulatory guidance recommends using a high dose that elicits maximal immune response in the test species . This ensures the vaccine’s pharmacologic effect is stressed, maximizing the chance to observe any immune-mediated toxicities. Typically, three dose levels are included in toxicology studies (in addition to a placebo control):

- Low dose: a dose at or slightly above the projected human dose (on a µg/mouse or µg/kg basis). This provides relevance to clinical exposure.

- Mid dose: an intermediate level (e.g. \~3× the human dose equivalent) to explore dose-response.

- High dose: a high-exposure dose (e.g. \~10× human dose, or the dose that saturates antibody response in animals ). For mRNA vaccines, this could be limited by formulation tolerability; however, use of the maximal immunogenic dose is advised even if it exceeds the planned clinical dose, to ensure a safety margin .

Dose unit selection (µg of mRNA per animal vs. µg/kg) should be justified. For vaccines, per-animal dosing (fixed dose per injection) is often used, mimicking the human regimen, since immune activation tends to depend on absolute dose per site rather than body weight. For example, if the human dose is 50 µg, rat studies might use doses of \~50 µg, 250 µg, and 500–1000 µg per injection to achieve 1×, 5×, and 10–20× the human amount, respectively. These levels have precedent: mRNA COVID-19 vaccine studies in rats used doses on the order of 30–100 µg per dose (for a human dose of \~30 µg) without serious toxicities . All animal dose levels will be delivered in the same formulation (LNP) and volume per injection as intended clinically (e.g. \~0.1–0.5 mL intramuscularly) to maintain comparable local exposure.

Dosing Regimen: The dosing schedule in animals should reflect the intended clinical schedule . If the vaccine will be given as a prime-boost (two-dose) regimen in humans (\~3–4 weeks apart), the repeat-dose tox study should mirror that (e.g. two IM injections 21 or 28 days apart) . This allows evaluation of both initial and booster dose tolerability and potential immune exacerbation on second dose. If the clinical plan is a single dose (as might be the case for a seasonal flu shot), a single-dose toxicology study with an appropriate observation period can suffice, though including a second dose is often still useful to simulate a worst-case scenario (multiple exposures). In efficacy models, at least a prime-boost regimen is recommended for novel vaccines in naive animals to ensure robust immunity prior to challenge , whereas in previously influenza-exposed animals a single booster may be evaluated . All animal studies will use the intramuscular (IM) route of administration, typically in the thigh or shoulder muscle, consistent with the intended human route . Using the clinical route in animals is required to ensure the local tissue exposure and immune trafficking are representative of human vaccination .

## **In Vitro and In Vivo Study Designs**

### **In Vitro Assays**

Non-clinical development will include several in vitro assays to characterize the mRNA vaccine’s activity and safety profile before in vivo testing:

- mRNA Expression and Protein Characterization: A cell-based expression assay will be used to confirm that the delivered mRNA produces the intended influenza antigen (e.g. hemagglutinin, HA) in vitro. For example, transfecting the LNP-formulated mRNA into cultured mammalian cells (such as HEK293 or CHO cells) and then measuring HA protein levels (by Western blot or ELISA) will verify proper translation and folding. The expressed HA protein’s functionality can be assessed via a hemagglutination assay with red blood cells, confirming that the antigen can bind sialic acid receptors similar to wild-type viral HA.

- Potency Assay: An in vitro potency or bioassay will be developed to quantify the vaccine’s biological activity lot-to-lot. This may overlap with the expression assay above. For instance, a luciferase reporter mRNA of analogous design can serve as a surrogate: when LNP-encapsulated luciferase mRNA is added to cell culture, luminescence output correlates with mRNA delivery efficiency and translational potency . This helps set release specifications and ensures consistency in the formulated vaccine’s capability to transduce cells.

- Innate Immune Activation (Cytokine Release) Assay: Because mRNA and lipid nanoparticles can stimulate innate immunity, in vitro assays will evaluate cytokine responses. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or whole blood will be incubated with the mRNA-LNP to measure rapid cytokine release (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α, type I interferons). This cytokine release assay helps predict acute reactogenicity or potential for cytokine storm. Acceptable levels are those comparable to or lower than known safe vaccines. Any ex vivo cytokine testing using human blood will follow recommended safety margins to ensure no excessive inflammatory signals prior to first-in-human trials .

- Inflammation/Complement Activation Assays: If the LNP contains novel excipients (e.g. PEGylated lipids), an in vitro complement activation test (e.g. measuring C5a in human serum after exposure) might be performed to assess risk of infusion reactions (such as CARPA). Additionally, in vitro pyroginicity (LAL endotoxin test) will be done on the vaccine preparation, and any specific assay for innate sensor activation (e.g. TLR assays using reporter cell lines) can characterize the immunostimulatory profile of the mRNA (which often includes nucleoside modifications to dampen innate sensing).

- Stability and Protein Binding Studies: In vitro studies will also examine the stability of the mRNA-LNP in biological fluids. Incubating the vaccine in simulated physiological conditions (37°C, in serum) and sampling over time for mRNA integrity (via RNA gel or RT-PCR) will estimate the half-life of the mRNA outside cells. This informs on how quickly the mRNA might be degraded by extracellular RNases after injection. Also, plasma protein binding and lipoprotein interactions of the LNP will be studied, as apolipoprotein association can influence biodistribution (e.g. ApoE binding leading to hepatic uptake ).

### **In Vivo Models**

A variety of in vivo models will be used to evaluate the pharmacology and safety of the mRNA influenza vaccine:

- Rodent Toxicology Model (Rat): As described, rats will serve as the primary model for GLP toxicology. Groups of rats will receive the vaccine or control as per the dose regimen, and will be observed for toxicity endpoints (clinical signs, body weight, clinical pathology, and histopathology of all major organs). Rats are large enough for serial blood sampling and full necropsies, enabling thorough safety evaluation including local tolerability at the injection site. The rat model will also be used for toxicokinetics of the vaccine if needed – although classical pharmacokinetic studies are not required for vaccines, we may measure systemic exposure of the mRNA (by plasma qPCR) and any induced cytokines post-dose to characterize the acute phase response .

- Rodent Immunogenicity Model (Mouse): Mice will be used to rapidly assess immunogenicity and guide vaccine dose/formulation optimization. Inbred strains (such as Balb/c) allow detailed immune phenotyping. Mice (5-10 per group) will be immunized with various dose levels of the mRNA vaccine. Key readouts include antigen-specific antibody titers (total IgG and neutralizing antibodies) and T-cell responses (e.g. IFN-γ ELISpot for CD8⁺ T cells against influenza epitopes). This small animal model enables screening of immune responses to different vaccine variants (e.g. modified mRNA vs unmodified, or different lipid formulations) prior to advancing the final candidate. Mouse data will also confirm the Th1/Th2 bias of the immune response by isotyping antibodies (IgG2a vs IgG1) and measuring cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-4). A Th1-biased response (indicative of cell-mediated immunity) is generally preferred for viral vaccines to avoid potential vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) that can occur with Th2-skewed profiles .

- Ferret Efficacy Model: Ferrets (outbred, young adults) will be employed for pathogen challenge studies to demonstrate vaccine efficacy. Ferrets are uniquely susceptible to human influenza viruses and exhibit respiratory illness similar to humans. In the efficacy study, ferrets will be vaccinated (two doses IM) and then challenged with live influenza virus (e.g. H1N1 or H3N2 strain matching the vaccine antigen, or a heterologous strain for breadth testing) via the intranasal route. Outcomes will include reduction in viral load in nasal washes and lung tissue, mitigation of clinical signs (fever, weight loss, nasal discharge, sneezing, lethargy scored via an index), and survival (if a high-dose, potentially lethal challenge is used). The ferret model also allows assessment of transmission, if needed, by co-housing vaccinated ferrets with naive sentinels after challenge to see if vaccine prevents virus spread. Ferret data will be pivotal in showing real-world protective effect, as evidenced in prior studies where mRNA influenza vaccines protected ferrets from disease after virulent virus challenge .

- Non-Human Primate Immunogenicity Model (Optional): While not strictly required, a NHP model (e.g. rhesus macaques) may be included to gather additional immunogenicity and safety data in a closer-to-human species. NHPs can receive the vaccine IM and be monitored for clinical observations and detailed immune responses, such as neutralizing antibody titers and T-cell memory responses in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage. Monkeys might not exhibit strong illness upon human influenza virus challenge (many strains cause only subclinical or mild infection), so NHPs would mainly serve to confirm the immunogenic profile (e.g. breadth of antibody response, durability of immunity) and to detect any primate-specific toxicities or exaggerated inflammatory responses that rodents/ferrets might not show. Given the expense and ethical considerations, NHP studies will be used judiciously, in line with the 3Rs (Replace, Reduce, Refine) principle, and possibly leveraged as part of a platform data package if similar mRNA vaccines have been tested in NHPs .

- Rabbit Model for Reproductive Toxicology: Although not part of initial IND-enabling work (unless first-in-human trials will involve pregnant individuals), ultimately a developmental and reproductive toxicity study in rabbits or rats will be planned in accordance with ICH S5 (R3). Rabbits are often chosen for developmental toxicity assessment of vaccines and were used for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine DART studies . This model would expose pregnant rabbits to the vaccine (e.g. before mating and during gestation) to evaluate embryo-fetal development and postnatal outcomes . However, this study is typically timed later (before Phase III or inclusion of women of childbearing potential in large trials) , not strictly for initial IND, and thus is mentioned for completeness.

Each in vivo model is designed to address specific questions (safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, efficacy), providing a comprehensive non-clinical dataset. All in vivo studies will be conducted with appropriate controls (e.g. placebo injection or comparator vaccine) and adhere to humane endpoints.

## **Biodistribution and Pharmacokinetics**

A dedicated biodistribution study will characterize how the mRNA vaccine distributes and clears in vivo, since traditional pharmacokinetic (PK) studies (blood drug levels over time) are generally not required for vaccines . Instead, regulatory guidance for mRNA vaccines emphasizes tissue distribution and persistence studies to understand where the mRNA/LNP and encoded protein go after injection . Key parameters and design features for the biodistribution/PK assessment are as follows:

Test Article and Species: The biodistribution study will use the fully formulated mRNA-LNP vaccine (with the same antigen sequence as the clinical candidate). Rodents (likely rats, e.g. 4–8 weeks old, female rats often used for distribution studies to also assess ovarian exposure) will be the test species. Rats are chosen for their size (enabling serial sacrifices and sufficient tissue per timepoint) and because prior biodistribution data on LNP-mRNA (e.g. COVID-19 vaccines) were generated in rats , allowing comparison. A small pilot in mice may be used if employing a reporter gene (like luciferase mRNA) for real-time imaging, but the definitive tissue quantitative study will be in rats with the actual vaccine construct.

Dosing and Time Points: Rats will receive a single IM dose of the mRNA vaccine (typically the high dose used in tox studies, to maximize detectability). A single dose is sufficient for distribution profiling; if multiple clinical doses are planned, distribution after the first dose is usually representative, though we will also assess whether repeated dosing leads to any tissue accumulation by possibly evaluating tissues after the second dose in a subset. Multiple sacrifice time points will be included to cover the kinetics of clearance: e.g. 6 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post-injection. At least 3 rats/sex per timepoint will be used (with possibly more at early times to capture variability). This schedule will capture the expected peak distribution (within hours) and the decline over days to weeks.

Tissues Analyzed: A broad panel of tissues will be collected at necropsy for analysis of mRNA and protein: injection site muscle (and skin around it), draining lymph nodes (e.g. inguinal or popliteal LN near injection site), spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, gonads (ovaries and testes), bone marrow, and blood plasma. These cover major organ systems and areas of interest (e.g. gonads for reproductive safety, brain to check if any crosses blood-brain barrier, etc.). Based on prior studies, we anticipate the highest mRNA concentrations at the injection site and in draining lymphatics, with some distribution to the liver and spleen via systemic circulation . Indeed, mRNA-LNP vaccines have shown that after IM injection, most of the expression (e.g. luciferase reporter) remains at the muscle and to a lesser extent in liver and spleen . We will confirm if the influenza mRNA behaves similarly.

Analytics: Quantitative RT-PCR will be the primary method to detect and quantify mRNA in tissues. Tissue samples will be homogenized and total RNA extracted, then a sensitive PCR assay specific to the mRNA sequence (e.g. amplifying the untranslated region unique to the vaccine) will measure mRNA copies per µg of RNA or per gram of tissue. This yields the concentration of mRNA in each tissue at each time. Additionally, if feasible, the LNP may be labeled (for example, with a trace of a radioisotope or a fluorescent lipid) to directly track nanoparticle distribution; the concentration of label in each tissue can be measured by scintillation counting or fluorescence, providing an independent measure of LNP biodistribution.

Encoded Protein Detection: While the main focus is the mRNA, we will also assess the distribution of the expressed antigen (influenza HA protein). This can be done by ELISA on tissue lysates or immunohistochemistry on tissue sections to see which cells are producing the antigen. Prior experiments with luciferase reporters show that protein expression is largely local (muscle) with minor expression in liver/spleen . For HA, we will confirm that significant protein is present at the injection site muscle fibers and in antigen-presenting cells in lymph nodes, and minimal elsewhere.

Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Key PK-like parameters to derive include:

- Peak tissue concentration (Cmax) of mRNA in key organs (and the time to peak, Tmax). We expect muscle at the injection site to have the highest Cmax, likely at the earliest time (within hours).

- Half-life (t½) of mRNA in tissues: by plotting mRNA copy number decline over time, an apparent half-life can be estimated. We anticipate a rapid drop in most tissues, with clearance of the bulk of mRNA within a few days as mRNA is translated and degraded. For instance, luciferase mRNA signal in muscle disappears within \~4 days in mice . We will quantify if any low-level mRNA remains at later time points (e.g. day 14 or 28\) in any tissue.

- Area-under-curve (AUC): although classical AUC (over time in plasma) is less relevant for locally acting vaccines, we can calculate AUC for mRNA presence in the bloodstream to gauge total systemic exposure. Plasma will be tested for mRNA at multiple early times (e.g. 1h, 6h, 24h) to see if mRNA enters circulation transiently.

- Persistence and Clearance: define when the mRNA is no longer detectable in each tissue. Complete clearance by a certain time is important for safety. If any tissue (e.g. lymph node or injection site) shows residual mRNA at later time points, that will be noted and investigated, though we expect clearance in the order of days to a couple of weeks at most.

- Metabolism: The study will also consider how the mRNA and LNP are metabolized. mRNA is expected to break down into nucleotides/nucleosides that are naturally handled by cellular metabolism (and thus not persist or accumulate). The LNP lipids may be metabolized via normal lipid pathways in the liver . We will document evidence of mRNA degradation (e.g. shorter RNA fragments via PCR, or loss of signal over time indicating metabolism to inert components). Any novel metabolites are not expected given the nature of mRNA and lipid components, but the study will be mindful of any unexpected persistence of chemically modified nucleosides in tissues.

Special Considerations: We will evaluate if the mRNA or protein crosses the blood-brain barrier or placenta. While not expected (and prior studies indicate almost no distribution to brain for IM route ), a sensitive PCR on brain tissue and, if applicable, on fetal tissues (in case of a pregnant animal, though we are not including pregnant animals in this distribution study) can address these theoretical concerns. The same applies to breast milk secretion (not applicable in our study design, but noted as a consideration in guidelines ).

All biodistribution work will adhere to good laboratory practice where possible. Absolute GLP compliance for biodistribution is not strictly required by regulators if the data are supportive (and not the primary safety determinant), but the study will be well-controlled and documented . If any part of the study is non-GLP (for example, use of an exploratory reporter construct), it will be justified and key portions (like qPCR quantification) may still be done in a GLP-compliant manner or with a QA oversight . The aim is to meet FDA/EMA expectations by providing a clear understanding of tissue distribution and clearance of the mRNA vaccine prior to human trials, confirming that no tissue retains significant levels of the product long-term and that the vaccine behaves like a typical non-replicating, non-persistent immunogen .

## **Immunogenicity and Efficacy Models**

Robust evaluation of immunogenicity (the immune response generated by the vaccine) and efficacy (protection against influenza) in non-clinical models is a critical component of IND-enabling studies. These data provide proof-of-concept that the mRNA vaccine induces appropriate immunity and can protect against influenza infection, guiding dose selection and supporting the rationale for human trials .

Immunogenicity Endpoints (Humoral and Cellular): The vaccine’s ability to elicit both antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses will be assessed:

- Humoral Immune Response: Serum samples from vaccinated animals (mice, ferrets, and optionally NHPs) will be tested for influenza-specific antibodies. The gold standard assay for flu vaccines is the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, which measures antibodies that prevent the virus from agglutinating red blood cells. An HAI titer of ≥1:40 is often correlated with protection in humans; we will use this as a benchmark . Additionally, neutralizing antibody titers will be determined using live virus or pseudovirus neutralization assays. This involves incubating serial dilutions of animal sera with influenza virus and then infecting cells, observing the reduction in viral cytopathic effect or viral gene expression. High neutralization titers indicate the vaccine induced antibodies capable of blocking virus infection. We will evaluate responses against the specific strain encoded by the vaccine and potentially drifted strains to gauge breadth.

- Isotype and Subclass: To understand the Th1/Th2 bias, IgG subclasses (in animals that have them, e.g. IgG2a/IgG1 in mice) will be measured. A Th1-biased response (IgG2a in mice, indicating strong IFN-γ environment) is generally desirable for viral clearance, whereas a Th2-skewed profile could indicate propensity for allergic-type responses. The presence of mucosal IgA (in nasal washes or bronchoalveolar lavage) will also be checked in ferrets or NHPs, as mucosal antibodies are important for blocking infection at the respiratory entry point.

- Cellular Immune Response: T-cell responses will be measured via assays such as ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Spleen cells or blood lymphocytes from immunized animals will be stimulated with influenza antigen peptides (e.g. conserved epitopes from HA, or NP if included) to detect antigen-specific IFN-γ producing T cells (CD4⁺ and CD8⁺). We aim to show the vaccine induces a Th1-biased T cell response (characterized by IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α production) rather than a Th2 response (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13). For example, a universal flu mRNA vaccine encoding internal proteins was shown to boost broadly reactive T cells in ferrets ; our HA-focused vaccine will mainly induce CD4⁺ T helper and follicular helper responses to aid antibody production, but CD8⁺ T cell responses to HA (and any other encoded proteins) will also be assessed. In NHPs, flow cytometry will be used to profile memory T cell subsets and their cytokine profiles (central vs effector memory, etc.). We will also monitor cytokines in serum after vaccination (transient IL-6, IFN-α, etc.) as an indication of innate immune activation which can shape the adaptive response.

- Duration of Immunity: Although full duration studies may go beyond IND stage, we will collect immune readouts at multiple time points (e.g. 2 weeks after prime, 2 weeks after boost, and periodically up to a few months) to get a preliminary sense of how long antibodies and T cells persist. This can inform booster timing in clinical trials.

Efficacy (Challenge) Studies: To demonstrate that immune responses correspond to actual protection, we will conduct challenge studies in animals:

- Ferret Influenza Challenge: As described, ferrets will be challenged with live virulent influenza after vaccination. Key efficacy endpoints include:

  - Clinical Disease Scores: Ferrets will be observed daily post-challenge for signs of illness (sneeze frequency, nasal discharge, activity level, breathing rate). A scoring system (0 \= normal, increasing to 3 or 4 for severe signs) will be used . Body weight will be measured daily; weight loss is a quantifiable indicator of disease severity in ferrets (e.g. \>10% loss is significant). Body temperature will be monitored (via implant or rectal thermometer) to detect fever responses; an elevated temperature from baseline indicates systemic infection. We will compare mean weight change and fever curves between vaccinated and control groups.

  - Viral Load Reduction: Nasal wash samples will be collected from each ferret at days 1-7 post-challenge to measure virus titers (using TCID₅₀ cell culture assay or RT-qPCR for viral RNA). We expect vaccinated ferrets to have significantly lower viral titers and a shorter duration of shedding than unvaccinated controls. At necropsy (around day 4-5 or earlier if humane endpoint criteria are met ), lung tissues will be collected to measure viral load in the lower respiratory tract. A successful vaccine should greatly reduce or eliminate virus in the lungs.

  - Survival: If the challenge virus dose is high enough to cause mortality in unvaccinated animals (e.g. a lethal H5N1 dose), then survival rate is a critical endpoint. Vaccinated animals should have improved survival. For example, in one study a high-dose H7N9 challenge was lethal to mock-vaccinated ferrets, whereas mRNA-vaccinated ferrets survived, demonstrating efficacy .

  - Pathology: Detailed pathology will be done on ferrets post-challenge. Lung tissues will be examined histologically for pneumonia, inflammation, and scored for severity of lesions. We anticipate that vaccinated ferrets will have minimal lung pathology compared to controls (which might show bronchopneumonia typical of influenza). The presence of any vaccine-associated enhanced disease (immunopathology) will be carefully looked for – e.g. an excessive eosinophilic or allergic inflammation would signal a problem (none is expected given an mRNA vaccine typically induces Th1 responses, but this was a concern historically for inactivated vaccines in naive models).

  - Protection in Other Models: If a mouse challenge model is also used (e.g. using a mouse-adapted influenza strain), endpoints would be similar: body weight loss, survival, lung virus titers, and lung pathology in vaccinated vs. control mice.

Correlates of Protection: The data from immunogenicity and challenge studies will be analyzed to identify correlates of protection (e.g. a threshold HAI or neutralizing titer that predicts protection from infection). These correlates can guide human trial immunogenicity targets. For instance, if ferrets with HAI titers \>40 all avoid severe disease, that titer might be a goal for the vaccine in humans.

Sample Size and Statistics: All immunogenicity and efficacy experiments will be designed with sufficient group sizes to detect meaningful differences. For ferret studies, 6–8 animals per group is typical to show statistically significant differences in viral load or weight loss. For mouse studies, groups of 10-15 per group (especially in survival experiments) may be used. Statistical analyses will include t-tests or ANOVA for parametric data (antibody titers, log-transformed viral loads), rank-sum tests for nonparametric data (scores), and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank test (for survival curves). A p-value \< 0.05 will be considered significant. The study protocol will pre-define primary efficacy endpoints (e.g. day 4 lung viral titer difference) to power the study appropriately.

Together, the immunogenicity and challenge studies will provide comprehensive evidence that the mRNA influenza vaccine can induce the desired immune profile and protect against influenza infection in relevant models. This satisfies regulatory expectations that a vaccine’s pharmacology (mechanism of action and efficacy) is well-characterized in animals before proceeding to human trials .

## **Regulatory Framework (Compliance with FDA, EMA, ICH Guidelines)**

All proposed studies are designed to comply with the applicable regulatory guidelines for IND-enabling non-clinical development of vaccines, including those from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), International Council for Harmonisation (ICH), and World Health Organization (WHO). Below is a summary of how the program aligns with these frameworks:

- Good Laboratory Practice (GLP): Pivotal safety studies – notably the repeat-dose toxicology study (and any safety pharmacology or local tolerance assessments) – will be conducted in compliance with GLP regulations (21 CFR Part 58\) . FDA and EMA expect that toxicity studies supporting first-in-human trials are GLP-compliant . Our toxicology protocol and facility adhere to GLP requirements: including a formal protocol approval, QA monitoring, archiving of raw data, and a GLP statement in the final report. If any part of a study is not done under full GLP (for example, a preliminary range-finding study or certain exploratory endpoints), this will be justified and clearly stated with description of deviations . The overall non-clinical data package will highlight which studies were GLP. Generally, toxicology and DART studies will be GLP, whereas efficacy/immunogenicity studies may be non-GLP (conducted with scientific rigor but not under GLP, as is standard for pharmacology proof-of-concept data).

- ICH Guidelines: The program follows ICH M3(R2) guidance on timing of non-clinical studies relative to clinical trials, ensuring that required safety studies are completed before human exposure. ICH M3 recommends that repeat-dose toxicity (of appropriate duration) in one species is sufficient to support a short-duration clinical trial for vaccines, and that any reproduction toxicity studies (e.g. DART) can be conducted prior to Phase III or licensure for vaccines not initially intended for pregnant women . We will comply with ICH S6(R1) (Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals) principles for selecting relevant species – which in the case of vaccines, means an immunologically relevant species rather than strictly requiring two species. This is consistent with WHO guidance that one responsive species is acceptable . For immunotoxicity, ICH S8 guidance (Immunotoxicity Studies) will be considered: though vaccines by design stimulate the immune system, we will assess if there’s any undue immunosuppression or autoimmunity potential (for example, by examining lymphoid organ histopathology and autoantibody screening in animals) to address S8 concerns. ICH S5(R3) (reproductive toxicology) is noted: as per S5 and WHO vaccine guidance, our developmental toxicity study (when conducted) will integrate fertility, embryofetal, and prenatal development endpoints into one study in one appropriate species (likely rat) .

- FDA/CBER Guidance: FDA’s guidance “Nonclinical Development of Preventive Vaccines” (2002) and related documents (e.g. CBER’s guidelines on adjuvants and COVID-19 vaccine guidances) emphasize that the scope of required studies depends on novelty of the product . For a novel mRNA vaccine platform, regulators expect a thorough demonstration of safety in animals prior to FIH . We will engage with FDA early (Pre-IND meeting) to confirm our plan, as FDA encourages discussing the specific nonclinical package needed for a given vaccine . Notably, FDA guidance suggests that if there is prior experience with a platform, some data can be leveraged, but for a new mRNA influenza vaccine (with perhaps prior mRNA COVID experience), we will still conduct product-specific tox and distribution studies. Our plan includes all elements FDA expects: immunogenicity characterization, dose-ranging in animals, GLP toxicity with full pathology, and characterization of distribution . We also abide by the FDA guidance that any toxicity and local tolerance studies used to support FIH must be completed and analyzed before dosing humans .

- EMA Requirements: EMA’s guidance for vaccines (e.g. EMA “Note for Guidance on Preclinical Pharmacological and Toxicological Testing of Vaccines”) aligns with FDA and WHO in requiring one relevant species for toxicity, demonstration of immune response in animal models, and justification of any novel adjuvant components. EMA has also indicated openness to platform technology data – for instance, data from other LNP-mRNA vaccines could support aspects of our IND . We will cite any available toxicology data from similar mRNA vaccines (such as published COVID-19 vaccine tox data) as supportive information, while still providing our own product-specific studies as required. EMA and other regulators (via ICMRA) have encouraged using prior platform data to streamline development , a strategy we embrace to avoid unnecessary duplication and to uphold 3R principles . However, since this is a new indication (influenza), we will conduct all critical studies (platform data will be supplemental). EMA will also expect a environmental risk assessment for any GMO aspects; however, mRNA vaccines are not self-replicating and degrade quickly, so they pose minimal environmental risk (this will be documented as well).

- WHO Guidelines: We have closely followed WHO’s “Guidelines on Nonclinical Evaluation of Vaccines” (WHO TRS 927, 2005\) in crafting this program. For example, WHO notes that the animal species should develop an immune response to the vaccine , and that the toxicity study should incorporate endpoints like clinical pathology, antibody measurements, and histology with special attention to injection site and immune organs . Our GLP tox study is designed accordingly, including local tolerance and antibody measurements. WHO also indicates that safety pharmacology (e.g. neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity) is generally not separately needed for vaccines unless specific concerns arise (we have not seen signals that mRNA vaccines have off-target pharmacologic effects, but we will monitor cardiovascular and neurological parameters within the tox study observations). Additionally, the WHO guideline (2013 update referenced in literature) states it’s not necessary that the species used for efficacy be the same as for safety, as long as the safety species is immunocompetent . In our plan, rats (safety) and ferrets/mice (efficacy) are different, justified by their purposes and biological relevance.

- GLP vs. Non-GLP Studies: Regulators recognize that efficacy models and mechanistic studies may not be GLP. Our non-GLP studies (such as the ferret challenge, mouse immunogenicity, and certain in vitro tests) will still be conducted with robust scientific method and documented appropriately, but we will clarify in the IND that these were not under GLP (permissible as they are pharmacology/proof-of-concept studies). The IND submission’s Pharmacology section will include these results to support the rationale and dosing for human trials, whereas the Toxicology section will contain the GLP tox report, clearly identifying its GLP status . Any deviations or exceptions (for instance, if a portion of the distribution study is non-GLP) will be justified in the IND in accordance with 21 CFR 312.23.

- Ethical Compliance: All animal studies will be reviewed by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) and conducted in AAALAC-accredited facilities, in line with FDA and EMA emphasis on animal welfare and the 3Rs. If any study can be refined or replaced (for example, using serology in lieu of some challenge studies), we will consider those to reduce animal use without compromising data integrity .

In summary, the non-clinical program is structured to meet or exceed regulatory expectations for an IND. By integrating guidance from FDA, EMA, ICH, and WHO, we ensure a thorough evaluation of safety (per GLP standards) and efficacy (per good scientific practices), providing regulators with confidence in the vaccine’s profile. Key regulatory documents (e.g. WHO TRS 927 , FDA’s guidance on vaccines ) will be cross-referenced in our IND to show alignment. The following sections present the study plans and protocols with this compliance framework in mind.

## **Tabulated Study Plans**

The table(s) below summarize the planned IND-enabling non-clinical studies for the mRNA influenza vaccine. Each study is listed with its purpose, design highlights, species, group sizes, dose levels, endpoints, and GLP status for clarity. These structured plans ensure all regulatory requirements are covered and make the development program easy to review.

Note: Additional specialized studies (e.g. genotoxicity and integration assessments) are not routinely required for mRNA vaccines. A bacterial reverse mutation test and an in vitro micronucleus test will be conducted to address any theoretical genotoxic risk of novel LNP components, although the mRNA itself is not expected to be genotoxic (an mRNA in vitro micronucleus assay for a similar platform was negative ). Carcinogenicity studies are not applicable to prophylactic vaccines. A separate Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity study (per ICH S5) in rats or rabbits will be planned before later-stage trials, as indicated earlier, but is not included in the initial IND-enabling package.

The above tables serve as a roadmap, ensuring each required study is well-defined and aligned with regulatory standards. All study protocols will be filed in the IND, and any changes will be documented via protocol amendments.

## **Narrative Study Protocols**

Below are detailed narrative protocols for each of the key non-clinical studies. These protocols include the study objectives, design, methodology, endpoints to be measured, and statistical analysis plan. Each protocol is written in a manner consistent with GLP documentation standards (where applicable) and can be used to execute the studies and for inclusion in regulatory submissions.

### **Protocol 1: GLP Repeat-Dose Toxicology Study in Rats**

Study Title: 28-Day Repeat-Dose Toxicity Study of an mRNA-LNP Influenza Vaccine in Rats (Intramuscular Administration) with a 2-Week Recovery Period.

Study Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the mRNA influenza vaccine when administered intramuscularly in rats at doses up to a projected high clinical multiple. The study aims to identify any target organ toxicities or local reactogenicity, characterize the immune response, and determine if findings are reversible after a recovery period. This study will support the safety of the vaccine for first-in-human trials by fulfilling regulatory requirements for nonclinical toxicology .

Test Article: mRNA influenza vaccine encoding hemagglutinin (HA) antigen of influenza A (H1N1 subtype, strain A/California/07/2009 or similar) encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (ionizable lipid, phospholipid, cholesterol, PEG-lipid). Nucleoside-modified mRNA, formulated in citrate buffer with sucrose. Lot \# and concentration will be specified. Stored at –70°C and formulated to dosing concentrations as needed. The same lot is used for all doses to ensure consistency.

Control Article: Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with empty lipid nanoparticles (without mRNA) – this matches the vaccine excipient composition, to isolate the effect of the mRNA. (If empty LNP itself may cause responses, a separate PBS-only group might be considered, but here we use “placebo” containing LNP to mimic the full formulation minus mRNA.)

Species and Strain: Rat (Rattus norvegicus), Sprague-Dawley strain (Crl:CD(SD)). Rationale: Rats are a standard rodent model for toxicology with large historical control databases . They are outbred (genetic diversity) which aligns with WHO recommendations for toxicity testing . This strain is known to be robust for immunological studies as well, producing antibodies to vaccine antigens (ensuring relevance of immunotoxicological findings) .

Number and Sex of Animals: 40 rats (20 male, 20 female) divided into 4 groups (10/sex/group). An additional 5/sex in control and high-dose groups will be included for recovery observations, for a total of 50/sex. Animals will be 8-10 weeks old at the start (young adult, sexually mature). Body weight \~200-250 g (females) and \~300-350 g (males) at dosing start. Animals will be individually identified by ear tag and housed 2-3 per cage (same sex) in an accredited vivarium. They will undergo an acclimation period of at least 5 days prior to dosing and be assessed by a veterinarian to ensure health status (no pre-existing conditions).

Grouping and Dose Levels: 4 groups as below:

- Group 1: Control (Placebo) – 0 µg mRNA, volume equivalent of PBS+empty LNP.

- Group 2: Low Dose – 0.1 µg mRNA (per injection). This is \~1× the anticipated human dose on a per-weight basis (approximately equivalent to 0.0005 mg/kg in a 200 g rat, which correlates to human 50 µg/70 kg \~0.0007 mg/kg, considering species differences).

- Group 3: Mid Dose – 1 µg mRNA (per injection). (\~10× human dose per weight).

- Group 4: High Dose – 5 µg mRNA (per injection). (\~50× human dose per weight; expected to be maximal immunostimulatory dose in rats). Rationale: Doses are scaled roughly to achieve a broad margin; 5 µg in rat (\~0.025 mg/kg) is anticipated to elicit a strong immune response . If formulation permits, we aim for at least a 10-fold multiple of the clinical dose in absolute amount .

Each dose will be given in a fixed volume of 0.25 mL per rat (to mimic human injection volume proportionally). Concentrations will be adjusted such that 0.25 mL contains the desired µg of mRNA for each group. Both sexes will receive the same dose (not scaled by body weight, consistent with vaccine dosing strategy of fixed doses).

Route and Regimen: Intramuscular (IM) injection into the quadriceps muscle of the hind leg. Dosing schedule: Day 1 (Prime) and Day 22 (Boost). These two administrations mimic a prime-boost regimen, which is relevant since many influenza vaccine schedules may involve two doses for naive individuals. The 21-day interval is chosen to allow immune response development and to test for any increased reactogenicity upon second exposure (potential immune-mediated effects). The injection site will alternate limbs for the two doses (e.g. left leg on Day 1, right leg on Day 22\) to allow local site evaluation independently.

All injections will be performed under light anesthesia (e.g. isoflurane) to minimize animal discomfort and ensure accurate IM delivery. Needles (e.g. 25G) will be inserted into the muscle belly. The actual injected dose (in µg and mL) for each animal will be recorded.

Observational Period: Animals will be observed up to Day 29 for main necropsy (1 week after second dose) and a subset (recovery groups) up to Day 43 (additional 2 weeks recovery without dosing).

Clinical Observations:

- Mortality/Moribundity: Checked at least twice daily. Any moribund animal will be humanely euthanized and considered as an unscheduled sacrifice; full necropsy will be performed.

- Detailed Clinical Exams: Once daily, rats will be examined for general appearance, behavior, and any signs of illness or injection site reactions. Particular attention to: piloerection, posture, gait, respiratory distress, oral/nasal discharge, and any neurological signs.

- Injection Site Reactions: The injected hindlimb will be inspected daily for redness, swelling, or warmth. A scoring system will be used (e.g. 0 \= no reaction, 1 \= slight redness/swelling, 2 \= moderate, 3 \= severe). Palpation will be done gently to detect any mass or induration.

- Body Weight: Measured on Day 1 (pre-dose), Day 2, then at least weekly (Days 8, 15, 22 pre-second dose, 29, and 43 for recovery animals). More frequent weights (e.g. twice weekly) will be taken during the first week after each dose to monitor any acute weight changes.

- Food Consumption: Measured weekly per cage. Not expected to change drastically, but any reduction might indicate systemic toxicity.

- Body Temperature: In a subset of 3 rats/sex/group, rectal temperature will be measured at baseline and at 4-6 hours post-dose on Days 1 and 22 to detect acute pyrogenic response (fever). An increase of \>1.5°C from baseline will be noted.

Clinical Pathology: Blood samples will be collected via retro-orbital sinus or tail vein (under brief anesthesia) from all main-study animals:

- Interim (if applicable): If any concerning clinical signs arise, interim blood sampling may be done (e.g. 24-48h after first dose to check for cytokine storm or acute inflammatory response).

- Terminal (Main necropsy Day 29): all animals (10/sex/group) euthanized on Day 29 will have blood drawn prior to euthanasia.

- Recovery Termination (Day 43): remaining rats (5/sex in Control and High dose) will be sampled.

The following analyses will be performed:

- Hematology: Complete blood count (CBC) with differential (RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCHC, platelet count, WBC count with neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils). We will pay special attention to neutrophil counts and acute phase reactants as indicators of inflammation.

- Clinical Chemistry: Panel including ALT, AST, ALP (liver function), BUN, creatinine (renal), glucose, electrolytes, C-reactive protein or fibrinogen (if available, as an inflammation marker), and CK (muscle enzyme, for muscle injection-site damage).

- Coagulation: PT and aPTT to detect any coagulopathy (e.g. if systemic inflammation triggers clotting changes).

- Cytokines: Serum from a subset of animals (3/sex/group) at 6h post-dose (Day 1 and Day 22\) will be frozen for cytokine analysis (IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, etc.), to characterize the innate immune activation profile. This is an exploratory endpoint to contextualize any acute reactions.

Immunogenicity Assessments: Although not a primary objective of a tox study, we will evaluate the immune response in these animals:

- Antibody Titers: Serum collected at necropsy (Day 29\) will be tested for anti-HA IgG by ELISA and HAI titer. This confirms the rats did mount an immune response (expected in high dose especially) and can help interpret any immune-mediated findings (e.g. immune complex deposition, if any, which is unlikely).

- Neutralizing Antibodies: If sufficient serum is available, a microneutralization assay will be done.

- These immunological endpoints also address regulatory interest in understanding the product’s activity in the tox species (ensuring the rat is a relevant model that responds to the vaccine).

Necropsy and Gross Pathology: On the scheduled necropsy days (Day 29 for main, Day 43 for recovery), animals will be euthanized by CO₂ asphyxiation (or overdose of anesthetic) followed by exsanguination. A complete gross examination of external surfaces, all orifices, and the cranial, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities will be performed. All organs will be examined in situ and then removed and weighed as appropriate.

- Organ Weights: Liver, kidneys, spleen, brain, heart, lungs, adrenal glands, gonads (testes or ovaries), and injection site muscle (in the form of dissected muscle plus draining lymph node) will be weighed for each animal. Thyroid (with parathyroid) and thymus will also be weighed if required (thymus weight can indicate stress/involution).

- Gross Lesions: Any abnormal finding (e.g. nodules, discoloration) will be recorded and the tissue preserved for histology.

Histopathology: Tissues from all animals in control and high-dose groups will be processed for microscopic examination, and any tissues with macroscopic abnormalities from any group will also be examined. Additionally, because this is a vaccine, we will examine immune organs in all dose groups to catch dose-dependent changes. The tissue list includes:

- Injection site muscle (with surrounding tissue) – expect local inflammatory changes.

- Draining lymph node (e.g. inguinal LN) – likely reactive hyperplasia expected due to antigen stimulation .

- Distant lymphoid organs: Spleen, distant lymph nodes (e.g. axillary if not directly draining).

- Heart, lungs, liver, kidneys.

- Stomach, intestines (to see if any incidental findings, though IM vaccine not expected to affect GI directly).

- Brain (including sections of cerebrum, cerebellum) – to rule out any encephalitis or unexpected distribution; although unlikely, included for completeness.

- Bone marrow (sternum or femur) – to assess hematopoiesis or any marrow activation/suppression.

- Thymus (especially in younger rats) – check for lymphoid changes.

- Endocrine: thyroid, adrenals.

- Reproductive organs: testis, epididymis, ovaries, uterus – ensure no effect on reproductive tissues (important since LNP-mRNA in prior studies had slight distribution to ovaries in some cases).

- Any site of note from clinical obs (e.g. if a rat had limping, examine that limb etc.).

All tissues will be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (except eyes in Davidson’s fixative if needed, but eyes are not target for IM vaccine typically). Bone tissues decalcified appropriately.

Histological sections will be stained with H\&E and evaluated by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. Special stains may be employed if needed (e.g. Gram stain if an abscess is suspected, etc.). We will specifically look for:

- Inflammation: at injection site (characterize cellular infiltrate: neutrophils vs lymphocytes, etc., and grade severity minimal/mild/moderate/severe ), and any evidence of systemic inflammation in organs.

- Immune organ changes: spleen and LN hyperplasia (expected due to immune response; will be noted as an expected pharmacologic effect if present).

- Liver: any hepatocellular degeneration or sinusoidal inflammation (LNPs often go to liver , we check for Kupffer cell aggregates, etc.).

- Kidney: any glomerular changes or inflammation.

- Heart: inflammatory cell infiltrates (myocarditis is unlikely but monitored given mRNA vaccines have rare association with myocarditis in humans; though typically not seen in rats).

- Lungs: any inflammatory or eosinophilic infiltrates (to catch any potential hypersensitivity).

- Injection site muscle: necrosis/regeneration patterns (some necrosis at injection site can occur from both needle and immune reaction, which typically resolves; regeneration will be noted).

- Any other lesions: such as granulomas (possible at injection site if LNP causes a localized reaction), or any unusual findings (e.g. evidence of immune complex deposition in vessels or kidneys would be significant to note, though not anticipated).

For low- and mid-dose groups, histopathology will initially be done on any tissues that had treatment-related changes in the high dose, to evaluate dose-response. If high-dose has essentially no lesions beyond expected minor inflammation, lower doses may be examined only for injection site and lymphoid organs for completeness.

Local Tolerance: Although integrated in observations and histopathology, we will specifically evaluate local tolerability. This includes the acute injection pain/response (none beyond transient prick expected), and chronic changes at injection site (like muscle fiber regeneration, fibrosis or granuloma formation). According to WHO, local tolerance should be part of tox study ; our design addresses this with detailed injection site exams and histology.

Recovery Phase Evaluations: For the recovery subset (control and high-dose, 5/sex each):

- These animals will be observed for 14 additional days post main necropsy to see if any toxic effects reverse or if any delayed effects appear.

- Body weights and clinical observations continue weekly.

- On Day 43, they undergo blood sampling for CBC/chemistry and then necropsy with the same protocol. Key organs previously affected in high-dose will be examined to see if they returned to normal (e.g. any injection site inflammation resolved).

- This will help distinguish persistent vs. transient findings (e.g. if liver enzyme was mildly high on Day 29 but normal by Day 43, it indicates reversibility).

Statistical Analysis: Data will be captured by electronic data capture where possible and compiled for statistical analysis:

- For continuous endpoints (e.g. body weight, organ weight, clinical pathology values), group means and standard deviations will be calculated. We will perform a one-way ANOVA comparing treatment groups to control for each sex. If ANOVA is significant (p\<0.05), Dunnett’s post hoc test will identify which dose groups differ from control. If data are not normally distributed or variance is heterogeneous, a non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s post test) will be used.

- For incidence data (like presence of a lesion, or proportion of animals with fever), a Fisher’s exact test may be used.

- Injection site score data, which are ordinal, might be compared via non-parametric tests (e.g. Kruskal-Wallis).

- The significance threshold is set at α \= 0.05. All significant findings will be reported, but emphasis will be on consistent, dose-related trends considered likely treatment-related.

- We will also evaluate toxicologically significant changes (e.g. a small but statistically significant change in one enzyme might not be biologically meaningful if within historical control range ). The study report will integrate statistical results with expert judgment.

Quality Assurance: The study will be conducted in compliance with GLP. The protocol and any amendments will be reviewed by Quality Assurance (QA). QA will inspect critical phases (dosing, clinical obs, necropsy, data analysis) and audit the draft report. A compliance statement will be included. All raw data, specimens, and the final report will be archived per GLP.

Expected Outcomes: Based on experience with other mRNA LNP vaccines, we anticipate no serious toxicity. Expected findings include:

- Mild to moderate injection site inflammation (histologically, with possibly slight edema/redness clinically) .

- Reversible enlargement of draining lymph nodes/spleen due to immune stimulation .

- Transient increases in neutrophils or cytokines after injection (reflecting innate immune activation) .

- Possibly mild liver enzyme elevations in high dose, corresponding to LNP uptake in liver, but without histopathological liver damage .

  No dose-limiting toxicities were seen in analogous rat studies for other mRNA vaccines (e.g. Moderna’s rat tox showed only expected inflammatory changes and no organ toxicity ). This study will confirm that the influenza mRNA vaccine has a similarly benign non-clinical safety profile, supporting progression to human trials.

### **Protocol 2: Non-GLP Biodistribution and Pharmacokinetic Study in Rats**

Study Title: Biodistribution and Persistence of mRNA-LNP Influenza Vaccine in Rats following Intramuscular Injection.

Objectives: To quantitatively determine the tissue distribution, persistence, and clearance of the mRNA vaccine and its expressed antigen following IM administration in rats. This study will identify which tissues the mRNA and lipid nanoparticle travel to beyond the injection site, how long they last, and whether any accumulation occurs. It will also measure the kinetics of mRNA decay and protein expression, providing data on pharmacokinetic behavior (distribution and elimination) which is not obtainable via standard plasma PK for this modality .

Rationale: As per regulatory expectations for novel nucleic acid vaccines, biodistribution data are required in lieu of traditional PK . This informs on safety (ensuring no unexpected organ exposure or long persistence) and helps interpret any toxicology findings by correlating them with distribution profiles (e.g. if liver changes were noted, did mRNA go to liver).

Test Article: Same mRNA-LNP influenza vaccine as in tox study (Lot \#X). For detection purposes, an identical formulation encoding a reporter (firefly luciferase mRNA) may be used in a subset of animals to visually confirm distribution via IVIS imaging . The primary data, however, will come from the actual HA mRNA formulation measured by PCR.

Species: Rat (Wistar Han strain, 8-10 weeks old, female). Female rats are chosen to evaluate distribution to ovaries (a particular interest area); distribution in males is expected to be similar aside from reproductive organs, so primarily females suffice. If possible, a few males will be included to check testes distribution as well.

Group Design: This is a serial sacrifice design. Approximately 42 rats (36 females \+ 6 males) will be used. Six timepoints are planned post-dose with n=6 females per time (except final time which may use remaining animals). Additionally, at the first timepoint, 2 males will be included, and at the last timepoint, 4 males included to examine male gonads at early and late times.

Proposed timepoints (post injection):

- 0.25 days (6 hours)

- 1 day (24 hours)

- 3 days (72 hours)

- 7 days

- 14 days

- 28 days

At each timepoint, 6 rats will be euthanized for tissue harvest. We might adjust timepoints based on preliminary data (e.g. add a 2-day or 21-day if needed for curve definition). The final timepoint (28d) is to ensure near complete clearance or to identify any very long persistence.

All rats receive a single IM dose of the vaccine in the quadriceps (same site, no repeat dosing to keep data interpretation straightforward).

Dose: A high dose of 5 µg mRNA (the high dose used in tox) in 0.25 mL will be administered. Using the high dose maximizes detection sensitivity in tissues. Lower doses would simply scale down all signals and might risk some being below detection threshold. The dose is non-toxic as per tox study expectation, so it’s safe to use for this purpose.

Sample Collection and Methods: At each timepoint, rats are euthanized (overdose anesthesia followed by exsanguination). Blood is collected via cardiac puncture (for plasma) before perfusion. To reduce blood contamination in tissue, a PBS perfusion through the heart may be done for certain tissues like liver and spleen (optional if needed to distinguish blood vs tissue content of mRNA).

Tissues collected:

- Injection site muscle (with overlying skin): The entire area receiving the injection will be excised.

- Draining lymph nodes (inguinal or iliac LN near injection).

- Distant lymphoid organ: Spleen.

- Liver.

- Kidneys.

- Heart.

- Lungs.

- Brain.

- Ovaries (in females, both ovaries).

- Uterus (females).

- Testes (in included males).

- Blood (plasma).

- Additionally, urine and feces can be collected from cages (to see if any excretion of mRNA or its fragments, though unlikely significant since mRNA breaks down in tissues, not excreted intact).

Each tissue is divided: a portion snap-frozen for RNA analysis, a portion in formalin for possible histology or IHC (for protein).

Analytical Procedures:

- mRNA Quantification (qRT-PCR): Using a validated quantitative reverse-transcription PCR assay specific to the vaccine mRNA:

  - We will design primers/probe for a unique sequence (e.g. the junction of 5’UTR and coding region, or the poly(A) tail region) to avoid amplifying any endogenous transcripts.

  - Standard curve will be made with known copies of the mRNA spiked into control tissue homogenates to quantify absolute copy numbers.

  - Tissues will be homogenized (e.g. with a bead-beater or rotor-stator) in Trizol or appropriate lysis buffer to extract RNA. A fixed amount of an external RNA standard may be spiked in as QC.

  - After extraction, reverse transcription to cDNA and real-time PCR will be performed. Results expressed as copies of mRNA per mg of tissue (or per mL of plasma).

  - Sensitivity is expected to be \<100 copies per sample reliably. We will include negative controls (tissues from an uninjected rat) to ensure no false positives.

  - Data will be reported as mean ± SD for n=6 at each time, for each tissue.

- LNP Lipid Quantification: If a radiolabeled lipid is used (for instance, trace ^3H or ^14C on the PEG-lipid or ionizable lipid), tissue samples will be processed by solvent extraction and scintillation counting to measure disintegrations per minute, converting to microgram-equivalents of lipid per gram tissue. Alternatively, if a fluorescently labeled lipid is available, we can measure fluorescence in tissue extracts (though autofluorescence may complicate). This will help confirm distribution patterns (e.g. mRNA vs lipid might show similar distribution, as expected since the complex likely stays together, except perhaps some lipid goes to liver via ApoE/LDL mechanisms ).

  - Key interest is in liver and spleen: LNP lipids often accumulate in hepatocytes via ApoE coating , so a higher liver signal for lipid than mRNA might be seen (since mRNA may degrade, but lipid stays longer in liver).

- In Vivo Imaging (optional): A subset of 3 rats at each early timepoint could receive a co-formulated luciferase mRNA-LNP (in addition to the HA mRNA, or in separate matched groups) to visualize protein expression. These rats would be anesthetized and imaged with an IVIS at 6h, 24h, 3d for bioluminescence. As known, luminescence is expected at injection site and possibly in liver region . This non-GLP imaging data corroborates the PCR data in a qualitative way. After imaging, these rats would be euthanized and tissues processed same as others (hence they contribute to the qPCR data too).

- Protein (HA) Detection:

  - ELISA: A sandwich ELISA for HA antigen can be performed on tissue lysates (especially muscle at site and lymph node). We’ll use a known anti-HA antibody pair to detect the HA. This indicates actual translation occurred in those tissues.

  - Immunohistochemistry: Fixed tissues (injection site muscle, LN, spleen, liver) will be sectioned and stained with an anti-HA antibody to localize which cells express the antigen. We expect muscle fibers near injection site and antigen-presenting cells in LN and spleen might be positive. If found, that matches expectations of immune processing.

- Data Collected: For each tissue/timepoint:

  - mRNA concentration (copies/mg tissue).

  - Possibly % of injected dose (%ID) in whole organ if organ weights are known and distribution uniform (e.g. calculate how much of total dose resides in liver at peak).

  - For plasma: mRNA ng/mL at various times to see any systemic exposure.

  - For each, we will tabulate the decline over time.

Endpoints and Parameters:

- Peak levels (Cmax) in each tissue and the corresponding time (Tmax). Likely:

  - Muscle: highest at 6h or 24h (based on prior data showing peak \~6h ).

  - Liver: possibly peak at 6h or 24h as well due to initial drainage of nanoparticles to liver via blood.

  - LN: might peak slightly later if mRNA drains gradually via lymph (maybe 24-72h).

- Half-life in major tissues:

  - We will calculate an apparent half-life by log-linear regression of the decline phase. For muscle, if it drops 90% by day 4 , half-life might be \~1 day. For liver, some slower decline might occur due to uptake by hepatocytes; we’ll quantify it.

- Extent of Persistence: The last timepoint (28d) will show if any tissue still has detectable mRNA. Ideally, all are near or below the detection limit by 28d. If any tissue (like a lymph node or spleen) still has small amounts, we’ll note it but presumably it will be extremely low (likely below functional relevance). Similarly, we’ll see if any HA protein persists (unlikely beyond a few days since antigen will be cleared or metabolized by immune cells).

- Comparative distribution: The relative exposure of tissues: we expect Injection site \> Liver ≥ Spleen \> LN \> others. Prior studies showed strong muscle signal and weaker liver . We will verify this pattern. We’ll also confirm minimal to no mRNA in brain (should be none above background; any detected might be due to blood or very minor if any crosses).

- Sex differences: If male data included, compare ovary vs testis uptake. Any high level in ovaries will be noted (previous LNP mRNA studies showed low but detectable in ovaries , but no effect on fertility in DART studies ).

- Excretion: If we measure, likely no intact mRNA in urine (perhaps some nucleosides could be, but we won’t specifically measure metabolite excretion unless needed; presumably no intact excretion as the kidneys filter small \<5nm molecules only).

Statistical Analysis: Mainly descriptive. We will compute means and SD for each tissue at each time. If modeling is needed, we might fit a two-phase exponential decay model to estimate half-lives. No hypothesis testing per se, but we will look at any differences (like male vs female gonad distribution) qualitatively.

Quality and Compliance: This study is non-GLP, but critical phases (sample analysis) will follow SOPs similar to GLP. An internal QA review of the analytical method validation and data integrity will be done. The protocol deviations, if any, will be documented. Since it’s supportive, regulators allow non-GLP with justification .

Interpretation: We expect to demonstrate:

- The mRNA largely stays local with partial systemic distribution to liver and spleen .

- Rapid clearance of mRNA (majority gone in days) .

- No long-term retention; by day 28 most tissues have no quantifiable mRNA.

- LNP lipids may persist slightly longer in liver (a class effect) but at levels not causing pathology.

- These results will be integrated with tox findings (e.g. if liver had slight immune cell infiltration in tox, we might attribute to the known liver uptake of LNP).

  This protocol thus yields essential data to satisfy regulatory concerns about where the vaccine goes after injection and how long it remains .

### **Protocol 3: Mouse Immunogenicity Study**

Study Title: Immunogenicity Dose-Ranging Study of mRNA Influenza Vaccine in Mice.

Objectives: To assess the immunogenic profile of the mRNA influenza vaccine at different dose levels in a mouse model. The study will determine the magnitude and type of immune response (humoral and cellular) elicited by low, medium, and high doses. The results will guide selection of an optimal dose for further development and provide early proof-of-concept of vaccine efficacy (neutralizing antibodies) in a small animal. Additionally, this study will evaluate the Th1/Th2 polarization of the response, addressing safety concerns such as potential Th2-biased immunopathology.

Rationale: Mice are well-established for immunogenicity testing and allow multiple dose groups. The use of dose-ranging helps identify if a lower dose could still be effective, or if a higher dose provides significantly greater immunity (or plateaus) . It also offers insight into dose-response which can support the justification of the clinical starting dose. While mice are not the primary efficacy model, robust neutralizing antibody generation in mice has been correlated with protection in ferrets and humans .

Test Article: mRNA-LNP influenza vaccine (same construct as above). Different dose levels will be achieved by diluting the formulation in buffer.

Animals: Mus musculus (house mouse), female (to avoid fighting seen in group-housed males and because female immune responses in mice can be slightly higher antibody-wise, though either sex is acceptable). Strain: BALB/c, 6-8 weeks old. Chosen because BALB/c tends to have a Th2-biased baseline response; if our vaccine can drive a Th1 response even in BALB/c, it’s a strong indicator of Th1 bias (on the other hand, C57BL/6 are Th1-prone; including BALB/c is a conservative test for potential Th2 skewing).

Group Design: 4 groups of 10 mice each:

- Group 1: Placebo (PBS \+ empty LNP, 50 µL IM).

- Group 2: Low dose (0.1 µg mRNA).

- Group 3: Mid dose (1 µg mRNA).

- Group 4: High dose (5 µg mRNA).

Doses selected similar to rat tox relative scaling (though absolute µg in a mouse is smaller due to its size). A 5 µg dose in a 20 g mouse is 0.25 mg/kg, which is a high but tolerable dose for a vaccine (some mouse studies of mRNA vaccines have used 10 µg or more per mouse successfully ).

Route/Regimen: IM injection into the quadriceps muscle. Two-dose regimen: Day 0 (prime) and Day 21 (boost). This regimen is chosen to mimic what might be done in humans (especially if aiming to test prime-boost). If the vaccine were intended as a single dose, we might still do a boost in mice to maximize the immune response for measurement (and to test for any enhancement or tolerance on second exposure).

Injection volume: 50 µL per leg. On Day 0 inject right leg, Day 21 left leg (to avoid local over-stressing one muscle).

Procedures/Observations:

- Monitor mice daily post-injection for any signs of adverse effects (lethargy, ruffled fur, injection site issues which in mice might appear as limping or redness).

- Body weights weekly; significant weight drop would indicate an adverse effect, but none expected at these small doses.

Sample Collection:

- Blood: Collect \~100 µL via submandibular bleed on Day 21 (just before boost) to measure primary response antibodies. Collect terminal blood via cardiac puncture at Day 35 (two weeks after boost).

- Spleen: At termination (Day 35), spleens will be harvested aseptically for cellular immune assays.

- Optionally, lymph nodes (draining) could be harvested for T-cell analysis if needed.

Immunological Assays:

Humoral Immunity:

- ELISA for HA-specific IgG: Standard ELISA plates coated with recombinant HA protein from the vaccine strain. Diluted serum from each mouse (Day 21 and Day 35\) will be tested. End-point titers or EC50 titers will be calculated. We expect dose-responsive titers, e.g. high dose yielding highest titers.

- Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) Assay: Using turkey or guinea pig RBCs and the homologous influenza virus (if available). Sera (Day 35\) will be treated (receptor-destroying enzyme and heat) and then tested for HAI titer. An HAI titer ≥40 is often considered protective in humans; we will see what titers mice achieve. Often mice need adjuvants to get high HAI; but mRNA has been shown to induce functional antibodies.

- Virus Neutralization Assay: Using live influenza virus (same strain as HA or a pseudovirus with HA and NA of that strain). Sera (Day 35\) will be incubated with virus, then added to MDCK cells. After 2-3 days, we will read neutralization via plaque reduction or cytopathic effect inhibition. We will report 50% neutralization titers (NT50). This is a key measure of vaccine-induced protective antibodies.

- IgG Subclass Analysis: In mice, IgG1 vs IgG2a (or IgG2c in some strains) indicates Th2 vs Th1 skewing. We will perform ELISA that differentiates IgG1 and IgG2a specific to HA. A higher IgG2a:IgG1 ratio suggests Th1 dominance (driven by IFN-γ), whereas high IgG1 would mean Th2 (driven by IL-4). We aim for balanced or Th1-biased response to avoid concern of Th2-dominated immunity which in some vaccines correlates with ERD (notably in RSV vaccine history).

Cellular Immunity:

- Splenocyte IFN-γ ELISpot: This will quantify the number of T cells producing IFN-γ in response to influenza antigens. We will use a peptide library spanning HA (and NP if our construct included NP, but here likely just HA so focusing on HA T-cell epitopes). Plates coated with anti-IFN-γ capture Ab, splenocytes added at 2-5×10^5/well, plus peptide pools (or live virus-infected APCs as stimulus). Spots counted after adding detection Ab and developing. A strong IFN-γ ELISpot response indicates robust T helper 1 (or CD8) response.

- IL-4 ELISpot or IL-5: If resources allow, an IL-4 ELISpot can measure Th2 cells. Or an IL-5 cytokine secretion assay. This helps ensure we are not getting a predominant Th2 response.

- Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS): Optionally, a subset of splenocytes can be stimulated with a dominant CD8 epitope (if known for HA in this mouse strain) and stained for IFN-γ, TNF, etc., to examine CD8 T cell activation. Also, CD4 T cells for IL-2, IL-4, IFN-γ. We expect an mRNA vaccine (with potent innate signals) will induce a mixed response with a lean towards Th1 cytokines .

- T cell memory markers: not in this short study, but if analyzing ICS, we might phenotype for central vs effector memory (CD62L, CD44 markers).

Other Immune Markers:

- Cytokines in serum post-vaccination: in a subset, bleed at 6h or 24h after prime to measure acute IL-6, MCP-1, etc. This is exploratory to see innate response intensity by dose. High dose may cause a transient higher cytokine level (which might correlate with reactogenicity but also adjuvant effect).

- B cell germinal center response: not doing, but could have done LN immunohistology. Possibly not in this small study.

Data Analysis:

- Compare dose groups for each immune measure. For example, use one-way ANOVA (or Kruskal-Wallis if non-normal) to see differences in ELISA titers or ELISpot counts across groups. If significant, compare each vaccine dose to control and to adjacent dose to see dose-responsiveness. We expect a plateau: mid vs high might not differ hugely if mid already saturated response.

- Specifically check if low dose is significantly less immunogenic than mid/high (to find minimally effective dose).

- Check subclass ratios: ideally, high dose yields IgG2a/IgG1 ratio \>1 (Th1-biased) whereas if we saw \<1 (Th2 bias) at any dose, that’s noted.

- No GLP needed; this is discovery. Data will be presented as group means ± SEM.

Endpoints:

- Primary: Neutralizing antibody titer on Day 35 (this is a surrogate for efficacy).

- Secondary: HAI titer, ELISpot IFN-γ count, IgG levels, etc.

- Safety observations: ensuring no weight loss \>10%, no untoward clinical signs.

Ethics: All mouse procedures will be IACUC approved. Blood volumes follow guidelines (max 1% of body weight per bleed etc.). Terminal spleen harvest requires euthanasia (CO₂ or overdose pentobarbital).

Expected Results: We anticipate the mid and high dose to induce high IgG and neutralizing titers. The low dose might be borderline in immunogenicity (which could indicate a need for a minimum amount of mRNA per dose). We expect a Th1 skew (given mRNA’s innate immune activation tends to favor Th1). If we observe an adequate response even at 0.1 µg, that suggests we might explore even lower dosing for safety margin, but likely the human dose \~50 µg is already in the upper range ensuring strong response in humans. The findings from this study (e.g. that 1 µg vs 5 µg yields similar antibody levels) could help justify not exceeding a certain dose in humans to avoid diminishing returns.

### **Protocol 4: Ferret Influenza Challenge Efficacy Study**

Study Title: Efficacy of mRNA Influenza Vaccine in a Ferret Model: Immunogenicity and Protection Against Viral Challenge.

Objectives: To evaluate the protective efficacy of the candidate mRNA influenza vaccine in ferrets by measuring its ability to prevent or mitigate influenza disease following a live virus challenge. The study will also characterize the immune responses in ferrets (both antibody and clinical outcomes) to confirm the vaccine’s mechanism of action. Endpoints include reduction in viral load, disease severity, and induction of influenza-specific antibodies. This study serves as a critical proof-of-concept for vaccine effectiveness in a model that closely resembles human influenza infection.

Rationale: Ferrets are highly susceptible to human influenza viruses and display similar symptoms (fever, sneezing, nasal discharge). Regulatory agencies expect demonstration of efficacy in a relevant animal model where feasible . Ferret data will strengthen the evidence of vaccine functionality beyond immunogenicity, showing actual disease prevention. It addresses any concerns of vaccine-induced disease enhancement (as ferrets have been used to identify enhanced disease in past vaccine studies by looking at pathology).

Study Design: Randomized, controlled challenge study with two groups of ferrets:

- Group 1: Vaccine Group – Ferrets immunized with mRNA vaccine.

- Group 2: Control Group – Ferrets given a saline placebo (or placebo LNP).

Group size: 6 ferrets per group (n=6). This provides the power to see differences in viral titers and clinical scores, given ferret variability is moderate and effect sizes are expected large (e.g. \~2-3 log difference in viral titer). All ferrets will be females (\~16-20 weeks old) or castrated males to avoid mating issues; weight \~0.8-1.2 kg at study start.

Blinding: The personnel assessing clinical signs and analyzing samples will be blinded to group assignments to reduce bias.

Vaccination Procedure: On Day 0, Vaccine group receives 50 µg of mRNA vaccine IM (25 µg in each hind leg muscle, 0.5 mL total volume). Control group receives 0.5 mL of saline IM split similarly. On Day 21, a second dose (booster) is given in the same manner. Injection sites will be monitored (though ferrets are quite tolerant to IM injections; only mild local reactions expected).

Ferrets will be observed after vaccination for any immediate reactions for 1 hour (none anticipated aside from maybe transient discomfort). Over the 3-week interval, periodic blood samples (Day 21\) will be taken to assess antibody development pre-boost.

Immunogenicity Assessments Pre-Challenge: On Day 35 (two weeks after boost, which is \~ one week before challenge), ferrets are bled for:

- Serum HAI titer against the challenge strain.

- Serum neutralization titer (if lab facilities for ferret serum testing; typically yes using microneutralization).

- These will confirm adequate immune response. We expect robust titers, similar to what effective human vaccines induce, in Vaccine group, and baseline or low titers in Controls.

Challenge Virus: A live influenza virus that the vaccine is designed to protect against, e.g. Influenza A H1N1 (pdm09) if the vaccine encodes H1 HA. We will use a wild-type human isolate (or minimally adapted) that is known to cause disease in ferrets. Titer \~10^6 TCID₅₀ (tissue culture infectious dose 50\) per ferret, administered in 1 mL total (0.5 mL per nostril) intranasally. This dose should reliably infect unvaccinated ferrets and cause moderate disease (weight loss, fever) but limited mortality (ferrets usually don’t die from human flu strains, except highly pathogenic ones). If using a high-mortality strain (like H5N1 highly pathogenic), we’d do intratracheal inoculation with a defined lethal dose to evaluate survival , but for a seasonal H1N1 we focus on morbidity reduction.

Challenge is performed on Day 42 (3 weeks post-boost). Ferrets will be lightly anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine) during virus instillation to ensure it’s inhaled properly and to minimize distress.

Post-Challenge Monitoring:

- Clinical Signs and Scoring: A composite clinical score will be assigned daily for each ferret, assessing:

  - Activity level (0 \= normal, 1 \= slightly less playful, 2 \= lethargic but responds, 3 \= very lethargic or unresponsive).

  - Respiratory signs (0 \= normal, 1 \= occasional sneeze, 2 \= frequent sneezing and nasal discharge, 3 \= labored breathing).

  - Appetite (0 \= normal, 1 \= ate \~50%, 2 \= ate \<25% or not eating).

  - Each category can be scored and summed. If any ferret reaches a humane endpoint score (like total score ≥4 out of maximum 6 or so , or loses \>15% body weight), it will be euthanized and counted as a severe disease outcome.

- Body Weight: Measured daily. We expect control ferrets to lose weight (possibly 5-10% by day 5), and vaccinated ferrets to have minimal weight loss (or quicker recovery).

- Body Temperature: Monitored by implantable temperature loggers or rectal thermometer at same time each day. Ferrets typically have baseline \~38°C; fever defined as \>39°C. Duration and peak of fever will be compared. Controls likely show fever on days 2-3; vaccinated maybe blunted or none.

- Nasal discharge: qualitatively noted (clear, mucoid, bloody?).

- Behavior: recorded (activity, grooming, sneezing frequency).

  All clinical data recorded by blinded observers.

- Viral Shedding: We will collect nasal washes or throat swabs on days 2, 4, 6, 8 post-challenge (or until virus is not detected). To do a nasal wash: a small volume (\~1 mL) of sterile saline is instilled into one nostril and recovered (often ferrets sneeze it out into a collection bag or we aspirate gently). This sample is used for viral titer:

  - Quantitative RT-PCR for viral M gene to get genome copies.

  - Virus titration on MDCK cells to get TCID₅₀ or plaque-forming units. The latter is key to show live virus reduction. We expect vaccine group to have significantly lower titers at peak (day 2 or 4\) and possibly clear virus faster (maybe cleared by day 6-8 vs controls still shedding).

- Terminal Viral Load: All ferrets will be euthanized on day 5 post-challenge (unless survival is an endpoint; see below). Day 5 is chosen when unvaccinated ferrets typically still have virus in lungs for an H1N1 and peak illness is around day 2-4. At euthanasia:

  - Collect lung tissues (each lobe separately if needed) for virus titration (homogenize and titer).

  - Collect nasal turbinates for virus titration to see local replication.

  - The viral load in lungs is a critical measure of vaccine efficacy; vaccinated animals should have much lower lung viral titers .

  - If the study is using a strain that can cause severe disease, we might extend observation to day 14 for survival analysis. In that case, viral load would be measured in any animals that succumb or at study end.

- Pathology: On day 5, a necropsy is done:

  - Lungs are examined. We may score gross pathology (percentage of lung affected by consolidation). Then fix lungs for histology.

  - Histopathology: lung sections (from all lobes or representative lobes) stained H\&E. Look for bronchopneumonia, inflammatory cell types, edema, etc. Possibly immunohistochemistry for influenza antigen to localize residual virus.

  - Other organs: trachea, nasal turbinates histology, and any other organ if needed (brain for H5N1 if concerned about neuro invasion, etc.).

  - Compare pathology severity between groups: e.g. average lung inflammation score (on 0-4 scale). Expect vaccine group to have minimal changes, control moderate bronchitis, bronchiolitis, alveolitis.

- Immunologic analysis post-challenge:

  - On day 5, we can also collect blood for serology to see if anamnestic response started (likely too early though).

  - Spleen or lymph nodes could be harvested for memory B/T analysis, though not necessary for primary endpoints.

If a survival aspect is included (like with a more pathogenic challenge requiring to see if vaccine prevents death), the study design would slightly adjust:

- Monitor up to 14 days post-challenge.

- Humane endpoints for moribund animals.

- Survival would be compared by Kaplan-Meier (log-rank test).

  For standard seasonal strains, death is not expected, so survival may not be an endpoint, instead focusing on morbidity and viral clearance.

Outcome Measures and Analysis:

- Primary efficacy endpoint: Reduction in lung viral titer at day 5 in vaccinated vs control (compare mean log₁₀ TCID₅₀; expect a few logs reduction).

- Secondary endpoints: include peak nasal wash titer, total viral shedding (AUC of nasal titers over time), percentage body weight loss, clinical score, and lung pathology score.

- Statistical tests: Two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U for comparing viral titers (if non-normal). Repeated measures ANOVA for weight curves. Fisher’s exact for incidence of fever or severe disease. Log-rank test if survival curve used.

- The study will be considered successful if vaccinated ferrets have significantly lower virus levels and clinical scores (p\<0.05) and no signs of enhanced disease.

- We will also ensure that no vaccinated ferret has worse outcomes than any control (to rule out any possibility of ADE or ERD).

Biosafety: The challenge will be done in appropriate containment (influenza typically BSL-2 for human H1N1/H3N2, BSL-3 for avian H5N1/H7N9). Staff will wear PPE and be vaccinated against flu or on antivirals to prevent their infection. All sample handling follows biohazard protocols.

Quality Considerations: Not GLP, but standard operating procedures for challenge studies are followed. The data will be recorded in study notebooks and electronic files. The challenge stock will be titer-verified. A randomization code for group assignment will be maintained.

Expected Results: We expect the mRNA vaccine to protect ferrets, evidenced by:

- Minimal weight loss (perhaps \<5%) in Vaccine group vs \~10% in Controls around day 3-4.

- Shorter fever duration or none in Vaccine group.

- A \>100-fold (≥2 log₁₀) reduction in peak nasal virus titer .

- Lung tissues from vaccinated ferrets might even be virus-free or near limit of detection, whereas controls have high titers.

- Histologically, vaccinated ferrets may show only mild peribronchiolar lymphocyte infiltrates (sign of an immune response) but no significant pneumonia, whereas controls have moderate bronchopneumonia.

- No evidence of enhanced disease in vaccinated ferrets (such as excessive eosinophils or immune complex deposition). Ferret studies with other vaccines (e.g. whole-inactivated RSV historically) showed enhanced pathology; we expect none here given the anticipated Th1 response and robust neutralizing antibodies.

- These outcomes will strongly support that the vaccine is efficacious, justifying progression to human trials where the primary endpoint might initially be immune response, but the animal data give confidence in likely protection .

---

Each of the above protocols will be finalized and approved by the sponsor and test facility before initiation. Any amendments will be documented. The results from all studies will be compiled into the IND filing, providing a comprehensive non-clinical data package that demonstrates the mRNA influenza vaccine’s safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in line with regulatory expectations.

Overall, the non-clinical program is designed to ensure a clear justification for proceeding to human trials, with thorough characterization of risks mitigated by appropriate study designs and compliance with GLP where required. The structured approach, from in vitro assays through in vivo efficacy, provides a sound scientific foundation for the IND and subsequent clinical development of the mRNA influenza vaccine.

### **Protocol for Genotoxicity Studies of an mRNA Influenza Vaccine**

#### **Study Title**

In Vitro and In Vivo Genotoxicity Studies for an mRNA Influenza Vaccine

#### **Objective**

The objective of this study is to assess the potential genotoxic effects of the mRNA-LNP influenza vaccine. Although mRNA-based vaccines do not integrate into the genome and are expected to degrade rapidly in the cytoplasm, regulatory guidance (e.g., ICH S2(R1)) recommends conducting genotoxicity tests, particularly if any novel excipients (such as lipid nanoparticles) are used. This study will evaluate:

- DNA mutagenicity via a bacterial reverse mutation assay (in vitro Ames test).

- Chromosomal damage via an in vitro micronucleus test (MN assay) in mammalian cells.

- In vivo DNA damage potential via a rat bone marrow micronucleus assay to assess systemic genotoxic potential following intramuscular administration.

These studies will establish whether the mRNA influenza vaccine or its LNP components have any genotoxic risk, fulfilling regulatory requirements for genotoxicity assessment prior to human clinical trials.

## **Study 1: Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames Test)**

### **Study Title:**

Mutagenicity Assessment of mRNA-LNP Influenza Vaccine Using the Bacterial Reverse Mutation (Ames) Test

### **Objective:**

To evaluate the potential mutagenicity of the mRNA-LNP influenza vaccine using a bacterial reverse mutation assay in accordance with OECD Test Guideline 471 and ICH S2(R1). This test detects point mutations in bacterial strains exposed to the test article, with and without metabolic activation.

### **Test Article:**

- mRNA-LNP influenza vaccine (fully formulated, containing mRNA encoding hemagglutinin antigen and lipid nanoparticles).

- Lot number: \[To be assigned\].

- Storage conditions: −70°C.

### **Control Articles:**

- Negative control: Sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or vehicle control (if the LNP requires a specific solvent).

- Positive controls:

  - Without metabolic activation: Sodium azide (for TA100, TA1535), 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide (for TA98, WP2 uvrA).

  - With metabolic activation (S9 mix): Benzo\[a\]pyrene (for TA98, WP2 uvrA), 2-Aminoanthracene (for TA100, TA1537, TA1535).

### **Bacterial Strains Tested:**

- Salmonella typhimurium strains: TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537.

- Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA (for detection of base-pair substitutions).

### **Dosing and Concentrations:**

- A range-finding study will be conducted first to determine the highest non-cytotoxic concentration of the test article.

- At least 5 test concentrations will be used, ranging from 0.1 µg to 500 µg per plate.

- Doses will be tested with and without an exogenous metabolic activation system (rat liver S9 fraction).

### **Study Design:**

- Plate Incorporation Method (for soluble test article).

- Pre-incubation Method (if the test article is poorly soluble in the agar medium).

Each concentration will be tested in triplicate under the following conditions:

1. Without metabolic activation (direct mutagenicity).

2. With metabolic activation (S9 mix, to simulate liver metabolism).

### **Endpoints and Evaluation:**

- Colony counting: Revertant colonies will be counted for each plate.

- Statistical analysis: A dose-dependent increase in revertant colonies that is at least twofold higher than the negative control in at least one strain will be considered a positive mutagenic response.

- Cytotoxicity assessment: Reduction in bacterial lawn density at high doses will indicate cytotoxicity, necessitating repeat testing at lower doses.

### **GLP Compliance:**

- This study will be conducted under GLP regulations as per OECD 471 and ICH S2(R1).

- QA monitoring will ensure compliance and documentation.

### **Expected Outcome:**

Given that mRNA vaccines do not directly interact with DNA and degrade rapidly in the cytoplasm, no mutagenic activity is expected. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been tested in similar vaccines (e.g., COVID-19 mRNA vaccines) without showing genotoxicity, supporting the hypothesis that this formulation will also be negative.

## **Study 2: In Vitro Micronucleus Assay in Mammalian Cells**

### **Study Title:**

Chromosomal Aberration Assessment of mRNA-LNP Influenza Vaccine Using the In Vitro Micronucleus Test

### **Objective:**

To evaluate the potential clastogenic and aneugenic effects of the mRNA-LNP influenza vaccine on mammalian cells by measuring micronucleus formation. This assay will determine if the test article induces chromosome breaks or aneuploidy (whole chromosome loss or gain).

### **Test System:**

- Cell line: Human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells (or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells) commonly used in regulatory genotoxicity assays.

- Dosing and exposure time:

  - Short-term exposure: 4 hours with and without S9 metabolic activation.

  - Long-term exposure: 24 hours without S9 activation.

- Doses tested:

  - Range-finding cytotoxicity study will determine 5-6 non-cytotoxic concentrations (typically from 1 ng/mL to 500 µg/mL).

  - Doses will be selected to cover a broad range of exposures while avoiding excessive cytotoxicity (≥50% reduction in viability is considered excessive).

### **Endpoints and Evaluation:**

- Micronucleus frequency: Cells with micronuclei will be counted and compared to control groups.

- Cytotoxicity assessment: Reduction in cell viability measured via relative survival or cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI).

- Statistical analysis: A significant, dose-dependent increase in micronucleus formation (≥2-fold above control) is considered genotoxic.

### **GLP Compliance:**

- This study will be conducted under GLP standards as per OECD 487 and ICH S2(R1) guidelines.

### **Expected Outcome:**

The mRNA-LNP formulation is not expected to induce chromosomal damage, given that similar lipid-based delivery systems have shown no genotoxic effects in regulatory studies for other mRNA vaccines.

## **Study 3: In Vivo Rat Bone Marrow Micronucleus Assay**

### **Study Title:**

Assessment of In Vivo Genotoxicity of mRNA-LNP Influenza Vaccine Using the Rat Bone Marrow Micronucleus Assay

### **Objective:**

To evaluate the potential for in vivo chromosomal damage following intramuscular administration of the mRNA-LNP influenza vaccine. This study will determine if the vaccine or its components induce micronuclei in dividing erythrocytes of the bone marrow, an indicator of DNA damage.

### **Test System:**

- Species: Rat (Sprague-Dawley, 8-10 weeks old).

- Group Size: 6 males \+ 6 females per dose group (to detect sex-related differences).

- Groups:

  - Control (PBS)

  - Low dose (1× human dose equivalent)

  - Mid dose (3× human dose equivalent)

  - High dose (10× human dose equivalent)

- Route of Administration: Intramuscular (same as intended clinical use).

- Dosing Schedule: Two IM injections (Day 1 and Day 22), with bone marrow collection 48 hours after the second dose (Day 24\) to assess peak genotoxic effect.

### **Endpoints and Evaluation:**

- Micronucleated erythrocytes per 2000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs).

- Ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic erythrocytes to detect cytotoxicity.

- Statistical analysis: A dose-related increase in micronucleated PCEs (≥2× control) would be considered genotoxic.

### **GLP Compliance:**

- This study will follow OECD 474 and ICH S2(R1) guidelines under GLP conditions.

### **Expected Outcome:**

Previous studies of mRNA vaccines have not demonstrated in vivo genotoxicity. Given the mechanism of action (cytoplasmic translation, no DNA interaction), no significant increase in micronucleus formation is expected.

---

### **Conclusion:**

These genotoxicity studies will ensure regulatory compliance and confirm the mRNA-LNP influenza vaccine does not pose a genetic toxicity risk. Results will be integrated into the IND submission, strengthening the safety profile for first-in-human trials.
